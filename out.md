There were 2 screening interviews done back to back. There was a coding exercise
for around 40 mins. This was quick code problem solving on coderpad, unlike the
60–90 min pair programming of the on-site interviews. Its main aim is to do a
quick check that one can code. You are supposed to write code in the language of
your choice and the problem given to me was to calculate the total sale price,
given the price of popcorn and soda at a movie theatre and the price of a bundle
if they are purchased together. I was able to code it in the time limit and ran
a few extra test cases to confirm.

The next interview was the Lifestory Interview with a talent management person.
This was a 60 minute non-technical interview. Much is said about this interview
online but I did not find it to be particularly hard. There are no trick
questions in this interview. You are asked about your background and timeline of
your career in details. There will be follow-up questions like your learnings,
bias for action, reason for choices made etc. My advice here would be to talk
about your past work and learnings passionately and don’t shy away from adding
any relevant personal event. Don’t forget to review your resume and its
highlights!

You need to craft your answers around the following:

-   Impact
-   Readiness
-   Trust
-   Engagement
-   Self-awareness

Things went quiet for a bit after the two interviews and I only heard back after
2 weeks from the same HR that they will move ahead with the on-site.

<!-- Shopify Canada Interview Experience
Entering the 100% remote Canadian e-commerce giant!


Shopify has made a name for itself in e-commerce in the recent years. Despite post pandemic challenges, the company has largely done well, is known for its 100% remote work policy and amazing employee benefits! I joined Shopify as an L7 Development Manager and wanted to share my interview experience for those who are preparing for Shopify.

Quick Overview
Role : Software Development Manager(L7)

Applied Through: Shopify Careers

Location: Remote Canada

Total interviews: 6(2 screening + 4 Virtual Onsite)

Duration: Around 4 weeks

Result: Offered

Overall Experience: 5/5

My experience: 10 years(2 years as a Manager)

Applying for the Role
I applied for the role through Shopify’s Career Website. Since I was working in Canada, I got a reply from a recruiter within a week to setup a recruiter chat. Note that while this is roughly for 20–30 mins and very casual, it is part of the screening process. I was asked about my background and expectation from the role. Later, she explained the next steps. I would also recommend going through a referral if you can get one. The process can be much faster in that case.

Meeting the Team(Onsite Interviews)

Before I went for the interviews, I was asked by the HR to go through Shopify’s blog on how they hire. A bunch of other details on the upcoming interviews were also shared over the email. I liked how much the onsite interviews resembled what was mentioned there. I met 4 people for a 60 min conversation with each. There were 3 technical interviews and one Management Life Story. I went through all the interviews in one day.

Pair Programming Interview

The first interview was a pair programming interview.

This has changed in the last few months to a 75–90 mins interview but I was among the last batch who interviewed in an older format where this was a 60 min interview. I was given a pretty straightforward question i.e to implement an LRU cache.

I was allowed to use language and IDE of my choice and share my screen. The interviewer was an Engineering Manager and was pretty helpful. I first gave possible options and then started coding the one which we both agreed on. I had the problem done in time and then I was asked to identify edge cases and write tests for the same. The interviewer was happy with the solution and last 5–7 mins were for me to ask any questions.

Management Life Story

This was a leadership interview of 60 mins with another L7 Engineering Manager. The interviewer set the stage in the first 5 mins and told me that he would be going through a bunch of questions primarily into categories like Strategy and Execution, Mission and Vision setting, Team building, growth, trust among team members etc. I was asked about my overall management experience and my current team size and structure before we dived into the questions. While some questions were standard “Tell me about a time when...” , others were a bit abstract. There was a quite a bit of focus on handling teams remotely and how pandemic and remote work impacted shipping capabilities of the teams I worked with. I was expected to provide examples from my past experience. Some of the questions I can recall were:

Have you ever managed a low performer?
How do you ensure growth opportunities for High performers in the team?
How do you ensure diversity in the team while hiring?
Have you managed a team that you inherited from another manager? How did you build trust with such a team?
How do you ensure team engagement while working remotely? How do you avoid burnouts within the team?
Have you ever had to make the decision to cancel a struggling project? How did I go about it?
Overall the interviewer was really nice and we spent last 10 mins discussing the expectations from a management role at the company.

Technical Problem Solving

This was 60 min interview with a staff engineer at Shopify. This was an abstract System Design interview.

I was asked to design a system to Manage Rare books in a library. The system was expected to create a report based on the condition of the book during last return. There should be a way to compare last 10 scanned images of the book to determine the most recent condition.

The focus was more around how the books would be scanned, stored and comparing images once a book is returned. I started by clarifying the requirements and drawing an overall design by the segregating it into services. There was not a lot of discussion on scale, however in the end the interviewer did ask me how would I change this design if this was a multi-tenant system managing libraries across the country. I was asked what APIs I would write. I wrote the structure of the REST APIs. Then we discussed the storage solution for the data for the books and handling image storage and archival. Finally, we touched on the reliability and system monitoring aspects like testing, logging, metrics etc.
It was healthy conversation with interviewer not trying to give me a hard time, yet being assertive on alternatives and requirement refinement as we went along. I wasn’t sure but did feel confident of my performance.

Technical Deep Dive

This was the final interview of the day where I met a Director of Engineering for about 60 mins. After a quick introduction and brief on my background, I was asked to describe my current(or a previous)project in details. This included details on functional goals, business impact, technical decisions and the overall architecture. I then moved to a Google Jamboard session to draw the overall system diagram. We went into details of every section and discussed the tech stack. I was queried on the choices made and the tradeoffs considered. The conversation then shifted to the success criteria and how we measured it. There were also questions around my roles and responsibilities and learnings from the project. The last part was a discussion on what changes I anticipate in the future for the product and what would I do differently in hindsight.

Overall, It went really well and the interviewer was visibly happy with the discussion. I think it was my best interview throughout the process. I would highly recommend to prepare for a project where you can dive deep in all aspects and preferably a one where you were a lead/manager or a mentor for the team, working closely with stakeholders!

Offer and Afterwards

I was told by the HR that there would be a candidate recap and I should hear back from them in a week. As I held another offer, informing that to the HR helped speed up the process and I got a positive response within next three days. Shopify’s offer was very competitive. They also offer perks like choosing between base pay and equity. There is also no cliff in vesting for subsequent stock rewards. The overall package included a joining bonus, base pay and equity. They gave me sufficient time for my joining and supported setting up a home office as well!

Final Thoughts
Last year Shopify went through a rough patch and also there were layoffs. However, the company fundamentals have remained strong and it still is one of the best employers in Canada. The interview and on-boarding experience was really good. The company also has a great culture, perks and most importantly for me, is fully remote!

I hope this helps in case you are preparing to appear for Shopify. Good Luck :) -->
